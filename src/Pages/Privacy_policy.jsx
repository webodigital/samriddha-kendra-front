          7. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>In Short:</strong> We may share information in specific
          situations described in this section and/or with the following third
          parties. We may need to share your personal information in the
          following situations:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your
            information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any
            merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or
            a portion of our business to another company.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>When we use Google Maps Platform APIs.</strong> We may share
            your information with certain Google Maps Platform APIs (e.g.,
            Google Maps API, Places API). Google Maps uses GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell
            towers to estimate your location. GPS is accurate to about 20
            meters, while Wi-Fi and cell towers help improve accuracy when GPS
            signals are weak, like indoors. This data helps Google Maps provide
            directions, but it is not always perfectly precise. We obtain and
            store on your device (cache) your location. You may revoke your
            consent anytime by contacting us at the contact details provided at
            the end of this document.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Business Partners.</strong> We may share your information
            with our business partners to offer you certain products, services,
            or promotions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="mt-5">
          8. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?
        </h2>
        <p>
          We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and
          store your information. We may use cookies and similar tracking
          technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when
          you interact with our Services, Some online tracking technologies help
          us maintain the security of our Services and your account, prevent
          crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site
          functions. We also permit third parties and service providers to use
          online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and
          advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to
          tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping
          cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The
          third parties and service providers use their technology to provide
          advertising about products and services tailored to your interests
          which may appear either on our Services or on other websites. Specific
          information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse
          certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-5">9. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p>
          We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the
          purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by
          law. We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
          necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a
          longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
          accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice
          will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the
          period of time in which users have an account with us. When we have no
          ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information,
          we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is
          not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
          stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
          information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion
          is possible.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-5">10. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
        <p>
          We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
          organisational and technical security measures. We have implemented
          appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security
          measures designed to protect the security of any personal information
          we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
          information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or
          information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so
          we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
          unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and
          improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
          Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
          transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at
          your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure
          environment.

          years of age. We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or

          you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to
          reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies,
          this could affect certain features or services of our Services. If you

        <h2 className="mt-5">13. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
          applications include a Do-Not-Track (DNT") feature or setting you can
          activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
          online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
          uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT
          signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to
          DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
          communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
          online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
          inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy
          Notice.
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-5">14. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>
        <p>
